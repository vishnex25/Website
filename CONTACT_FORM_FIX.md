# Contact Form Fix - Netlify Forms Only

## Issues Fixed

### 1. EmailJS 400 Error
- **Problem**: EmailJS was configured with placeholder values (`YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY`, etc.)
- **Solution**: Removed EmailJS completely since you want to use only Netlify Forms
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed EmailJS script from HTML head
  - Removed EmailJS configuration and initialization code
  - Simplified form submission to use only Netlify Forms

### 2. Netlify Forms 404 Error
- **Problem**: Form submission was not properly formatted for Netlify Forms
- **Solution**: Fixed form submission method and encoding
- **Changes**:
  - Added hidden `form-name` field to the form
  - Fixed form submission to use proper URL encoding
  - Submit to root path (`/`) instead of current pathname

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Head Section
```html
<!-- REMOVED -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@4/dist/email.min.js"></script>

<!-- REPLACED WITH -->
<!-- Contact form uses Netlify Forms - no external email service needed -->
```

### 2. Form Element
```html
<!-- ADDED hidden form-name field -->
<input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
```

### 3. JavaScript Form Submission
```javascript
// OLD: Complex dual submission system with EmailJS + Netlify
// NEW: Simple Netlify Forms only submission

const response = await fetch('/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
    body: new URLSearchParams(formData).toString()
});
```

## How to Test

### 1. Local Testing
Since Netlify Forms only work on Netlify hosting, local testing will show the form submission but won't actually send emails. To test locally:

```bash
# Start local server
python local-server.py
# OR
node local-server.js

# Open http://localhost:8000
# Fill out and submit the form
# Check browser console for "Netlify Forms submission successful"
```

### 2. Production Testing (Netlify)
1. Deploy your updated code to Netlify
2. Go to your live website
3. Fill out and submit the contact form
4. Check Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site Settings â†’ Forms to see submissions
5. Set up email notifications in Netlify Dashboard if needed

## Netlify Forms Setup

### 1. Automatic Detection
Your form is now properly configured with:
- `data-netlify="true"` attribute
- `name="contact"` attribute
- Hidden `form-name` field
- Honeypot spam protection

### 2. Email Notifications
To receive emails when forms are submitted:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to Site Settings â†’ Forms
4. Click on "Form notifications"
5. Add email notification with your email address

### 3. Form Management
- View submissions: Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site Settings â†’ Forms
- Export data: Available in the forms dashboard
- Spam filtering: Automatically handled by honeypot field

## Expected Behavior

### Success Case
1. User fills out form
2. Form submits successfully to Netlify
3. User sees success message: "ðŸŽ‰ Thank you! Your message has been sent successfully..."
4. Form resets
5. You receive notification (if email notifications are set up)

### Error Case
1. If submission fails, user sees: "There was an error sending your message. Please try again later."
2. Form remains filled for user to retry
