## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: EmailJS Configuration

1. **Create EmailJS Account**
   - Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - **Public Key**: Found in your EmailJS dashboard
   - **Service ID**: Create an email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - **Template ID**: Create an email template

3. **Update the Code**
   Replace these placeholders in `index.html`:
   ```javascript
   emailjs.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'); // Line ~886
   
   const emailResult = await emailjs.send(
       'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',    // Line ~943
       'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',   // Line ~944
       // ... template data
   );
   ```

4. **EmailJS Template Variables**
   Your template should include these variables:
   - `{{from_name}}` - Contact's name
   - `{{from_email}}` - Contact's email
   - `{{company}}` - Company name
   - `{{service_interest}}` - Selected service
   - `{{message}}` - Message content
   - `{{to_email}}` - Your admin email

### Step 2: Netlify Deployment

1. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Or drag and drop your files to Netlify

2. **Enable Netlify Forms**
   - Forms are automatically detected with `data-netlify="true"`
   - No additional configuration needed

3. **Form Notifications**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Forms
   - Set up email notifications to receive form submissions

## 🎯 How It Works

### Form Submission Flow
1. User fills out the contact form
2. Client-side validation runs
3. **Primary**: EmailJS attempts to send email
4. **Fallback**: If EmailJS fails, Netlify Forms takes over
5. Success notification shown to user

### PDF Download Flow
1. User fills out form (enables PDF button)
2. Clicks "Download PDF Copy"
3. jsPDF generates PDF in browser
4. PDF automatically downloads to user's device

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Local Testing
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Test both form submission and PDF download

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Test form submission (check your email)
3. Check Netlify Dashboard → Forms for submissions
4. Test PDF download functionality

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### EmailJS Issues
- **Error**: "EmailJS is not defined"
  - **Solution**: Check if EmailJS script is loaded
  - **Check**: Network tab in browser dev tools

- **Error**: "Invalid service ID"
  - **Solution**: Verify your EmailJS service ID is correct
  - **Check**: EmailJS dashboard for correct IDs

### Netlify Forms Issues
- **Forms not appearing in dashboard**
  - **Solution**: Ensure `data-netlify="true"` is in form tag
  - **Check**: Redeploy after adding the attribute

- **Spam submissions**
  - **Solution**: Honeypot field is already implemented
  - **Additional**: Enable reCAPTCHA in Netlify settings

### PDF Generation Issues
- **PDF not downloading**
  - **Solution**: Check browser console for jsPDF errors
  - **Check**: Ensure jsPDF script is loaded

- **PDF formatting issues**
  - **Solution**: Adjust PDF generation code in `generatePDF()` function
  - **Check**: Test with different form data lengths
